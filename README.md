## generate2vivo
generate2vivo is an extensible Data Ingest Tool for the open source software VIVO.
It currently queries metadata from [Datacite Commons](https://commons.datacite.org/), [ROR](https://ror.org/) and [ORCID](https://orcid.org/)
and maps them to the VIVO ontology using [sparql-generate](https://ci.mines-stetienne.fr/sparql-generate/index.html).
The resulting RDF data can be exported to a VIVO instance directly or it can be returned in JSON-LD.


### Installation
1. Clone the repository to a local folder using `git clone https://github.com/vivo-community/generate2vivo.git`
2. Change into the folder where the repository has been cloned.
3. Open `src/main/resources/application.properties` and change your VIVO details accordingly.
   If you don't provide a vivo.url, vivo.email or vivo.password, the application will not import the mapped data to VIVO but return the triples in format JSON-LD.
3. Run the application:
* If you have maven and a JDK for Java 11 installed, you can run the application directly via `mvn spring-boot:run`.

* Alternatively you can compile & run the application in Docker (with or without Java setup):
  ```dockerfile
  # with Java setup:
  mvn package
  docker build -t g2v .
  docker run -p 9000:9000 -t g2v
  
  # without Java setup
  docker build -f DockerfileBuild -t g2v .
  docker run -p 9000:9000 -t g2v

5. A minimal swagger-ui will be available at `http://localhost:9000/swagger-ui/`.

### Run in Command Line
Alternatively you can execute the queries in the command line using the sparql-generate executable JAR-file, since
each query is placed in a subfolder of `src/main/resources/sparqlg` and comes with its own `sparql-generate-conf.json`.
You can find the JAR-file and details about the configuration file and its use on the [sparql-generate website](https://ci.mines-stetienne.fr/sparql-generate/language-cli.html).
